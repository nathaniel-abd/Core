>Project by Nathaniel Anderson, Myles Carnell, and Vernon Tucker of Chester County High Scool for the Data Dev Competition

I, Nathaniel, maintained the majority of the Coding and Database configuration.
Vernon was in charge of designing and quality control, to ensure our website looked as good as possible.
Myles operated as the main creative head, making pitches for ideas of products to add and their names.

### Our Scope ###
The scope of our project was **_quite_** big. We wanted to make as much as we could with as many features as we could fit in.
We ended up requiring a lot of breathing room to prevent burn-out on the project, but it ended up conforming to the standards that we wanted at the start of this project

### Challenges ###
We wanted to have many features included, such as extra pages filled to the brim with our newest ideas and small info blurbs about them, but the code for it and our time to complete the whole project didn't line up and we had to scrap it. At the start, we wanted to make a small slideshow for the front page as it was something that we planned to have as one of our stand-out sections; however, we had tons of problems with the code from the moment we started work on it. We believe there was something wrong with the CSS that prevented it from functioning if the styles for it were on an external stylesheet, so we decided to keep all of the CSS internal to preserve it's working order. Additionally, we had trouble making sure images in the slideshow didn't stretch it as the resolution of the images changed, though we quickly figured out methods to keep the images crisp and the slideshow the same size.

### Content ###
With the amazing designs from Vernon, some of the few images that we did not create ourselves are the logos of the payment processors and our socials at the bottom of the page.
